# Shader Studies

This is a collection of notes and studies I'm using to learn shaders. In many of these experiments, I'm following tutorials to understand how they work; the links to those tutorials are included in the specific shader. I tried to include notes on how the shader works and my thoughts on them.

## Table of Contents

1. [Fresnel](Assets/Fresnel/README.md)
2. [Glitch](Assets/Glitch/README.md)
3. [Glowing Undulation]("Assets/Glowing Undulate/README.md")

There are more shaders than this list includes; I will update it once I finish documenting and cleaning them up.
